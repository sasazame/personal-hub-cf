## What Should Be Done Next?

### 1. Remaining Feature Migrations (Priority Order)

1. **Goals Feature Frontend Implementation**
   - Frontend UI components (GoalsList, GoalItem, GoalForm, GoalProgress)
   - Integration with the backend API
   - E2E test implementation

2. **Fix E2E Test Isolation Issues**
   - Improve the `clearAllTodos` helper function
   - Consider using database transactions or test-specific data
   - Ensure tests run independently without side effects

3. **Events Feature Migration**
   - Calendar integration
   - Recurring event support

4. **Notes & Moments Feature Migration**
   - Markdown support
   - File upload functionality

5. **Pomodoro Feature Migration**
   - Timer implementation
   - Session management

### 2. Additional Improvements

1. **OAuth Authentication Implementation**
   - Google OAuth
   - GitHub OAuth

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Dark mode support
   - Enhanced responsive design
   - Accessibility improvements

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Code splitting implementation
   - Cache strategy optimization

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Sentry integration
   - Structured logging implementation

### 3. Implementation Guidelines

1. **Maintain Type Safety**
   - Define Zod schemas in `packages/shared`
   - Share types between backend and frontend

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Create E2E tests before implementing new features
   - Write unit tests first for components

3. **Commit Conventions**
   - Use Conventional Commits format
   - Small, atomic commits

4. **Branching Strategy**
   - Develop on feature branches
   - Merge to main via PR
   - Automated checks via CI/CD pipeline

## Technology Stack (Reminder)

- **Backend**: Hono + Cloudflare Workers + D1 + Drizzle ORM
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TanStack Query + React Hook Form
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- **Authentication**: Lucia Auth
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript + Zod
